- **Aiming System** - Mouse movement controls shot direction
- **Turn-Based Multiplayer** - Players take turns hitting the ball
- **3-Hole Golf Course** - Built entirely with default Hytopia blocks

### 🏌️ Golf Course Layout
1. **Hole 1** - "Starter Hole" (Par 3) - Straight fairway, perfect for beginners
2. **Hole 2** - "Dogleg Right" (Par 4) - Features a sand trap and right turn
3. **Hole 3** - "Long Drive" (Par 5) - Longest hole with water hazard

### 🎮 Player Controls
- **Mouse Movement** - Aim your shot direction
- **Hold SPACE** - Charge power meter for shot strength
- **F Key** - Toggle aiming mode (camera follows ball)
- **R Key** - Reset ball position (if stuck)
- **Chat Commands** - Game management via chat

### 🎵 Audio & Visual
- **Sound Effects** - Ball hit, bounce, roll sounds using default SFX
- **Ambient Music** - Peaceful golf course atmosphere
- **Visual Feedback** - Power meter, aiming indicator, score display
- **Golf Club Visual** - Repurposed sword model as golf club

## 🚀 How to Play

### Starting the Game
1. **Join the Server** - Players spawn at the clubhouse
2. **Type `/startgolf`** - Begins the golf game for all players
3. **Wait for Your Turn** - UI shows whose turn it is

### Playing Golf
1. **Aim** - Move mouse to aim your shot direction
2. **Charge Power** - Hold SPACE to build power (watch the meter!)
3. **Release** - Let go of SPACE to hit the ball
4. **Wait** - Ball must stop before next player's turn
5. **Continue** - Play through all 3 holes

### Scoring
- **Strokes are counted** - Each hit adds to your score
